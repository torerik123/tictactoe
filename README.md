# Tic Tac Toe
Tic tac toe built with Flask

The game is won when either player "X" or "O" has three squares in a row in the vertical, horizontal or diagonal direction.
If all squares are full and no winner has been made, the game is tied. The user can then reset the game to play again.

After playing a move, the user has the option to undo the last move played and choose to play a different move.
Reset game clears all squares and starts the game again.
